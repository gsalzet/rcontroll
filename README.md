*rcontroll* integrates the individual-based  and spatially-explicit *TROLL* model to simulate forest ecosystem and species dynamics forward in time.
*rcontroll* provides user-friendly functions to set up and analyse simulations with varying community compositions, ecological parameters, and climate conditions.

## Description

The *rcontroll* package relies on a few functions in R to generate and provide inputs, prepare and run the simulations, 
and analyse the simulations through tables, figures, and maps that are easily connected to the rest of the R ecosystem.
The whole workflow can even be run for one or several simulations using a unique function (`troll` and `stack`). 
Pre-simulations functions include global parameters definition (`generate_parameters`) and species and weather data input, with default values for French Guiana included in the package. 
Simulations are run alone (`troll`) or as a stack (`stack`) and stocked in corresponding classes.
The post-simulation outputs are stored in the corresponding objects and can be accessed using object attributes (with `@` in R) in the form of simple R objects, mainly data frames, 
or summarised and plotted with the `print`, `summary` and `autoplot` methods. 
Simulations can be saved using a user-defined path when run and later loaded as a simple simulation (`load_output`) or a stack of simulations (`load_stack`).

## Installation

You can install the latest version of **rcontroll** from Github using the [`devtools`](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("sylvainschmitt/rcontroll")
```

## Usage

```r
library(rcontroll)
data("TROLLv3_species")
data("TROLLv3_climatedaytime12")
data("TROLLv3_daytimevar")
sim <- troll(name = "test",
             global = generate_parameters(iterperyear = 12, nbiter = 12*1),
             species = TROLLv3_species,
             climate = TROLLv3_climatedaytime12,
             daily = TROLLv3_daytimevar)
autoplot(sim, what = "species", 
         species = c("Cecropia_obtusa","Dicorynia_guianensis",
                     "Eperua_grandiflora","Vouacapoua_americana")) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```
