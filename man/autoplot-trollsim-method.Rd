\title{Plot TROLL simulation or stack}
\usage{
\S4method{autoplot}{trollsim}(
  object,
  what = "temporal",
  variables = NULL,
  species = NULL,
  iter = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{TROLL simulation or stack.}

\item{what}{char. What to plot: "temporal", "spatial" or "distribution".
"temporal" is for temporal trajectories of the whole ecosystem or defined
species. "spatial" is for spatial patterns in the initial or final forest.
"distribution" is for metrics distribution in the initial or final forest.}

\item{variables}{char. Which variable(s) to plot. Only one variable is
accepted when plotting "spatial".}

\item{species}{char. Which species to plot. NULL indicates the whole ecosystem
level. "all" can be used to use all species.}

\item{iter}{char. Which iteration(s) to plot, for temporal thinning or to
specify which forest to plot. "initial" or "final" can be used. NULL is
converted to "final".}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object.
}
\description{
This is a method to plot TROLL simulations, including either temporal
trajectories of whole ecosystem or species metrics, or the initial or final
pattern observed in the forest community. Metrics includes abundances of
individuals above 1cm (N), above 10cm (N10), and above 30cm (N30),
aboveground biomass (AGB), basal area of individuals above 1cm (BA), and
above 10cm (BA10), gross primary production (GPP), net primary production
(NPP), respiration of day (Rday), night (Rnight) and stem (Rstem), and
litterfall.
